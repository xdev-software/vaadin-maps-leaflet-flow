# vaadin-maps-leaflet-flow
A Vaadin Flow Java API for [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)

![demo](assets/demo.png)

## Usage

This API wraps the Leaflet API in a Vaadin friendly way.<br/>It uses a similar structure (classes, methods) as the [Leaflet JavaScript API](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html).

To get started it's recommended to have a look at the [demo](./vaadin-maps-leaflet-flow-demo), notably the [minimalistic example](./vaadin-maps-leaflet-flow-demo/src/main/java/software/xdev/vaadin/maps/leaflet/flow/demo/MinimalisticDemo.java).

> [!NOTE]
> **The API only supports sending instructions to the client**<br/>
> Due to data integrity retrieving client-side data (that can be modified by users) is not supported.
> * Event listeners can still be registered but this needs to be done manually.<br/>[An example is available in the demo](./vaadin-maps-leaflet-flow-demo/src/main/java/software/xdev/vaadin/maps/leaflet/flow/demo/EventDemo.java).
